# Spotify Clone 
A Spotify clone made from the tutorial 'Make a Spotify Clone from Scratch: JavaScript PHP and MySQL' by Reece Kenney on Udemy.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Install and configure XAMPP (or LAMPP). When the application is up and running, copy and paste Spotify folder into htdocs. You will need to provide your own music files and set up given queries for the mySQL database in phpAdmin before running the code.
